# Assets Folder

This folder should contain the application icons:

## Required Files

1. **icon.png** - PNG icon for the application (recommended 256x256 or 512x512)
2. **icon.ico** - Windows ICO icon for the application and tray
3. **background.jpg** - Background image for the main page (optional, as slideshow images are in src/images/)

## Icon Requirements

- The tray icon should be at least 16x16 pixels
- For best quality, provide icons at multiple resolutions
- Windows ICO should contain 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, and 256x256 versions

## Note

The application includes a fallback mechanism - if icons are not found, a simple purple placeholder will be used for the tray icon.

To create icons, you can use tools like:
- [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)
- [IconArchive](https://iconarchive.com/)
- [Figma](https://figma.com/) or any graphics editor
